This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<b> About </b>
Created a memory game with React. The assignment application UI is broken into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. 

<b> Requirements </b>
* Must be deployed.
* Create a new React application using Create REact App.
* The application should render different images to the screen. Each image should listen for click events. 
* The application keeps track of the user's score. The user'c score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click on the same image more than once. 
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order. 
* Once the user's score is reset adter an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
